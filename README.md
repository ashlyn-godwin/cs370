    Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
    
    For the project, I created the code under the QTest section of the file called Godwin_Samantha_Project2.ipynb. This code initializes and sets up a Q-learning implementation of a maze solving AI. The base functions were provided in two separate files: one containing rules related to the maze itself and another forming the experience side of the Q-learning algorithm. My code utilizes both of these files in order to create a functional algorithm that helps a pirate navigate a maze to a treasure. 
    
    Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
        What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
        
        Computer science is a vital field in today's world, and computer scientists perform many different roles depending on their subfield. They create new software, help keep infrastructure running, and have a hand in nearly every field in the modern age. Performing tasks efficiently and *ethically* is a requirement simply do to the amount of access a computer scientist can have to data. 
        
        How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
        
        First and foremost, problems should be approached with an ethically sound mindset. Especially in cases where personal user information could be involved, it is imperative that that data is protected and not used in a way that it could result in software that can negatively impact them in the long run. An instance a failure to meet this lies in the criminal sentencing software COMPAS, which created a "Risk Assessment Score" that supposedly calculated the risk of a convicted felon going on to commit another crime. It claims to have avoided racial bias in that it was able to correctly determine whether someone of any demographic would commit another crime about 60% of the time. However, the rate of false positives directed towards people of color was twice as high as those of white convicts, artificially increasing sentances for a large portion of the population. 
        
        What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
    
        As a computer scientist, it is extremely important to handle data responsibly. It is important that I complete tasks provided by the organization and deliver software that is functional and meets the requirements as dtermined by the plan. That being said, there is an ethical requirement that the software created should also not harm the end user in the process. Both of these are equally important due to the nature of work, and neither should be sacrificed in the elevation of the other. Doing so would be a failure of my job.
